# Ex. No: 15A - Build a Binary Tree with Float Values

## AIM:
To write a Python program to build a binary tree with a root, left, and right node using floating-point values.

---

## ALGORITHM:

1. **Start the program.**
2. **Import** the `Node` class from the `binarytree` module.
3. **Create a root node** using the `Node` class and assign a floating-point value.
4. **Create left and right child nodes** for the root with float values.
5. **Convert the tree** to a list and print the list of nodes.
6. **End the program.**

## PYTHON PROGRAM

```
import heapq

def heaptree(H):

heapq.heapify(H)
print("The created Heap is",H)
```
